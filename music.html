1. Add photos for the composers
2. Add music samples for the composers

    <!--introduce composers by era, start with baroque-->
    <p style="text-align: left"><b>Baroque Era: </b>I don't listen to much baroque music in my daily life, 
        but the influence these composers had on future generations
        is impossible to ignore, and therefore it is helpful to have
        a working knowledge of baroque composers and baroque music.

    <!--list of baroque composers (literally only bach)-->
    <ol style="text-align: left">
        <li><b>J.S. Bach (1685-1750): </b> Bach is a household name even
        in the twenty-first century. Although he did not have
        Access to the modern piano, many of his keyboard works
        written for earlier keyboard instruments like clavichord
        or harpsichord are staples for modern piano repertoire. 
        The works I listen to most are:
            <ul>
                <li>Goldberg Variations, BWV 998: Particularly the famous
                     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuY20YN6F4k">1981 Glenn Gould recording</a>. The legend around the origin of this piece is that Bach was commissioned to write the
                     work by a nobleman who had sleeping problems. The idea was that he would lie down
                    and have his harpsichordist play these variations for him when he couldn't sleep.</li>
                <li>Well-Tempered Clavier, BWV 846-893:  Again, Glenn Gould comes to the rescue</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <!--Introduce the classical era-->
    <p style="text-align: left"><b>Classical Era: </b> The classical era was my first
        serious introduction to classical music. It is the era that starts to see
        more emphasis on expression (due to figures like Beethoven), but still
        prioritized a consistency in style and form.

    <!--List of classical era composers-->
    <ol style="text-align: left">
        <li><b>Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827): </b> An absolute staple in 
            classical music history--probablythe most famous composer of all
            time. Apparently he was quite a moody fellow, and was easily irritated.
            He was well-known for playing the piano with great expression and would
            often break the strings on the pianos he played. Maybe partly due to this
            former fact, later in life he began to lose his hearing. Instead of giving 
            up on music,he took the legs off his pinao, set it on the ground, and played
            by feeling the vibrations of the notes.
            A couple of famous pieces:
                <ul>
                    <li>Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-Sharp Minor: Arguably his most recognizable
                        piano sonata, the classic "Moonlight Sonata." Interestingly, the name
                        was not given by Beethoven himself,
                        but by a German music critic and poet named Ludwig Rellstab in 1832. He
                        compared the first movement to moonlight shining upon 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Lucerne">Lake Lucerne</a> 
                        (a lake in Switzerland). The first movement of this sonata was the first
                        piece I learned to play on the piano. The second movement is often
                        underappreciated, but I think it is really beautiful too.
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlJHNufol8Q"></a>Here is a performance of this piece played by Daniel Barenboim.
